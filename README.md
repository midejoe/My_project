Pima Indians Diabetes Case study
--------------------------------

Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number
of diabetic patients is growing over the years. The main cause of
diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic
factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

Individuals with diabetes face a risk of developing some secondary
health issues such as heart diseases and nerve damage. Thus, early
detection and treatment of diabetes can prevent complications and assist
in reducing the risk of severe health problems. Even though it's
incurable, it can be managed by treatment and medication.

Researchers at the Bio-Solutions lab want to get better understanding of
this disease among women and are planning to use machine learning models
that will help them to identify patients who are at risk of diabetes.

We will use logistic regression to model the "Pima Indians Diabetes"
data set. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years
old of Pima Indian heritage. This model will predict which people are
likely to develop diabetes

Data Description:
-----------------

-   Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
-   Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral
    glucose tolerance test
-   BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
-   SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
-   Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
-   BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)\^2)
-   Pedigree: Diabetes pedigree function - A function that scores
    likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
-   Age: Age in years
-   Class: Class variable (0: the person is not diabetic or 1: the
    person is diabetic)
